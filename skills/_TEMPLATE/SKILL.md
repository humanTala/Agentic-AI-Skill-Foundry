  REPLACE THIS. Describe the symptom the user will type, not the feature you
  built. Two to four sentences. Start with the verbs a user would use, name the
  concrete artefacts involved, then add the near-misses.
  Does NOT fire on: list the close-but-wrong cases here.

# Skill name

One sentence on what this does and who it is for.

## When to use this

Fires when the user asks to:

- concrete trigger one — the words a user actually types
- concrete trigger two
- concrete trigger three

*Does NOT fire on:*

- the near-miss that would be wrong — and why it is different
- another near-miss

Be specific here. This section is what stops your skill hijacking unrelated
conversations once someone has thirty skills installed.


## Steps

1. First action. One thing per step.
2. Second action.
3. Third action.
4. Report back with <what the user gets>.

## Rules

- Hard constraint that must never be violated.
- Another constraint.
- If something must happen every single time, do not write it here — put it
  in scripts/ and call it. A rule in prose is advisory; a script is enforced.
